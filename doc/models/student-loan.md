## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AccountId` | `string` | Required | The ID of the account that this liability belongs to. |
| `AccountNumber` | `string` | Required | The account number of the loan. For some institutions, this may be a masked version of the number (e.g., the last 4 digits instead of the entire number). |
| `DisbursementDates` | `List<DateTime>` | Required | The dates on which loaned funds were disbursed or will be disbursed. These are often in the past. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). |
| `ExpectedPayoffDate` | `DateTime?` | Required | The date when the student loan is expected to be paid off. Availability for this field is limited. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). |
| `Guarantor` | `string` | Required | The guarantor of the student loan. |
| `InterestRatePercentage` | `double` | Required | The interest rate on the loan as a percentage. |
| `IsOverdue` | `bool?` | Required | `true` if a payment is currently overdue. Availability for this field is limited. |
| `LastPaymentAmount` | `double?` | Required | The amount of the last payment. |
| `LastPaymentDate` | `DateTime?` | Required | The date of the last payment. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). |
| `LastStatementIssueDate` | `DateTime?` | Required | The date of the last statement. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). |
| `LoanName` | `string` | Required | The type of loan, e.g., "Consolidation Loans". |
| `LoanStatus` | [`StudentLoanStatus`](../../doc/models/student-loan-status.md) | Required | An object representing the status of the student loan |
| `MinimumPaymentAmount` | `double?` | Required | The minimum payment due for the next billing cycle. There are some exceptions:<br>Some institutions require a minimum payment across all loans associated with an account number. Our API presents that same minimum payment amount on each loan. The institutions that do this are: Great Lakes ( `ins_116861`), Firstmark (`ins_116295`), Commonbond Firstmark Services (`ins_116950`), Nelnet (`ins_116528`), EdFinancial Services (`ins_116304`), Granite State (`ins_116308`), and Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (`ins_116945`).<br>Firstmark (`ins_116295` ) will display as $0 if there is an autopay program in effect. |
| `NextPaymentDueDate` | `DateTime?` | Required | The due date for the next payment. The due date is `null` if a payment is not expected. A payment is not expected if `loan_status.type` is `deferment`, `in_school`, `consolidated`, `paid in full`, or `transferred`. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). |
| `OriginationDate` | `DateTime?` | Required | The date on which the loan was initially lent. Dates are returned in an [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD). |
| `OriginationPrincipalAmount` | `double?` | Required | The original principal balance of the loan. |
| `OutstandingInterestAmount` | `double?` | Required | The total dollar amount of the accrued interest balance. For Sallie Mae ( `ins_116944`), this amount is included in the current balance of the loan, so this field will return as `null`. |
| `PaymentReferenceNumber` | `string` | Required | The relevant account number that should be used to reference this loan for payments. In the majority of cases, `payment_reference_number` will match a`ccount_number,` but in some institutions, such as Great Lakes (`ins_116861`), it will be different. |
| `PslfStatus` | [`PslfStatus`](../../doc/models/pslf-status.md) | Required | Information about the student's eligibility in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. This is only returned if the institution is Fedloan (`ins_116527`). |
| `RepaymentPlan` | [`StudentRepaymentPlan`](../../doc/models/student-repayment-plan.md) | Required | An object representing the repayment plan for the student loan |
| `SequenceNumber` | `string` | Required | The sequence number of the student loan. Heartland ECSI (`ins_116948`) does not make this field available. |
| `ServicerAddress` | [`ServicerAddressData`](../../doc/models/servicer-address-data.md) | Required | The address of the student loan servicer. This is generally the remittance address to which payments should be sent. |
