## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |

| `ItemId` | `string` | Required | The `item_id` of the Item associated with this webhook, warning, or error |
| `Error` | [`Error`](../../doc/models/error.md) | Required | We use standard HTTP response codes for success and failure notifications, and our errors are further classified by `error_type`.

Error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred. |
