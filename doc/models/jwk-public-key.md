# Jwk Public Key

A JSON Web Key (JWK) that can be used in conjunction with [JWT libraries](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io) to verify Plaid webhooks

*This model accepts additional fields of type object.*

## Structure

`JwkPublicKey`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Alg` | `string` | Required | The alg member identifies the cryptographic algorithm family used with the key. |
| `Crv` | `string` | Required | The crv member identifies the cryptographic curve used with the key. |
| `Kid` | `string` | Required | The kid (Key ID) member can be used to match a specific key. This can be used, for instance, to choose among a set of keys within the JWK during key rollover. |
| `Kty` | `string` | Required | The kty (key type) parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm family used with the key, such as RSA or EC. |
| `Use` | `string` | Required | The use (public key use) parameter identifies the intended use of the public key. |
| `X` | `string` | Required | The x member contains the x coordinate for the elliptic curve point. |
| `Y` | `string` | Required | The y member contains the y coordinate for the elliptic curve point. |
| `CreatedAt` | `int` | Required | The timestamp when the key was created, in Unix time. |
| `ExpiredAt` | `int?` | Required | The timestamp when the key expired, in Unix time. |
| `AdditionalProperties` | `object this[string key]` | Optional | - |
