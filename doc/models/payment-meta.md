# Payment Meta

Transaction information specific to inter-bank transfers. If the transaction was not an inter-bank transfer, all fields will be `null`.

If the `transactions` object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as `/transactions/get`, the `payment_meta` key will always appear, but no data elements are guaranteed. If the `transactions` object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as `/asset_report/get/` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.

*This model accepts additional fields of type object.*
