| `IntervalExecutionDay` | `int` | Required | The day of the interval on which to schedule the payment.<br><br>If the payment interval is weekly, `interval_execution_day` should be an integer from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday).<br><br>If the payment interval is monthly, `interval_execution_day` should be an integer indicating which day of the month to make the payment on. Integers from 1 to 28 can be used to make a payment on that day of the month. Negative integers from -1 to -5 can be used to make a payment relative to the end of the month. To make a payment on the last day of the month, use -1; to make the payment on the second-to-last day, use -2, and so on. |
| `StartDate` | `DateTime` | Required | A date in [ISO 8601](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Standing order payments will end on the last `interval_execution_day` on or before the `end_date`.<br>If the only `interval_execution_day` between the start date and the end date (inclusive) is also the same day that `/payment_initiation/payment/create` was called, the bank *may* make a payment on that day, but it is not guaranteed to do so. |
