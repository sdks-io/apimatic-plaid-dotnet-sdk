# Error

We use standard HTTP response codes for success and failure notifications, and our errors are further classified by `error_type`. In general, 200 HTTP codes correspond to success, 40X codes are for developer- or user-related failures, and 50X codes are for Plaid-related issues.  Error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred.

*This model accepts additional fields of type object.*
